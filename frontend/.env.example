# Frontend Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your values
# NEVER commit .env.local files to version control

# ============================================================================
# PUBLIC Variables (exposed to browser)
# ============================================================================
# These variables are prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ and are exposed to the browser
# NEVER put sensitive data in NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables

# API Gateway URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080

# WebSocket URL (same as API URL but with ws:// protocol)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080

# Environment (for conditional logic)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=development

# ============================================================================
# SERVER-SIDE Variables (NOT exposed to browser)
# ============================================================================
# These variables are only available server-side in Next.js
# Use these for sensitive configuration

# Sentry DSN (server-side only)
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn-here

# ============================================================================
# Production Configuration
# ============================================================================
# For production:
# - Set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL to your production API gateway
# - Set NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL to wss:// (secure WebSocket)
# - Set NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=production
# - Use HTTPS/WSS URLs only

# Example production values:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
# NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=wss://api.yourdomain.com
# NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=production

# ============================================================================
# Security Notes
# ============================================================================
# 1. NEVER put API keys, secrets, or sensitive data in NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables
# 2. All NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables are visible in browser JavaScript
# 3. Use server-side API routes for sensitive operations
# 4. Never commit .env.local files to version control
# 5. Use environment-specific values for different deployments
